## Key Technologies and Concepts

- **Python**: Versatile programming language used for backend development and ML.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for creating RESTful APIs and web apps.
- **Machine Learning & NLP**: Models and techniques including Transformers, attention mechanisms, tokenization, embeddings, sentiment analysis, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **FAISS**: Efficient similarity search for embedding vectors.
- **LangChain**: Framework to build applications powered by large language models.
- **Data Formats**: JSON, CSV for data interchange.
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing, augmentation, and embedding generation.
- **APIs & Security**: RESTful APIs, OAuth, JWT, CORS, and SSL/TLS for secure communication.
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, AWS/Azure/GCP.
- **Databases**: SQL and NoSQL options.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source control and collaboration.
- **Visualization & Interactivity**: Streamlit for interactive apps, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
- **Ethical AI**: Fairness, explainability, and bias mitigation.
